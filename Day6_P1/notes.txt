Extension Methods : Allows you to add the methods to the class from outside the class.  Assume a class is created by someone and you dont have copy of that,
but you need to add some methods to that class, can be done by using
extension methods. 

For extension method we need to use static classes and static methods. 

Generics : Generics provides an opportunity to protect a field in a class. Collections drawback is they can take any kind of data, means if i want to make any list only for Employees we cannot do that, but we can do that by using generics. 

If you want to make any method as write once and apply for all types, then we need the help of generics. 

Generics can be defined by using <T>, means in place of <T>, we can write any value types or reference types or custom types. 

Advantages : 

	(i) Write Once and apply for all types

	(ii) Provides security to the data 

	(iii) No Typecasting required

	(iv) Reduces the size of the program.
